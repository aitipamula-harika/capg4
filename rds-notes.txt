Hi All,

Connecting RDS DB through proxy using token from Lambda is working now!!!

I had made below changes for incident API lambda...



incident API template.yaml changes:

- Modified delegate-admin-fll-ReportBugFunction-Policy to add following:



Effect: Allow

Action:
- rds-db:connect
Resource:
- arn:aws:rds-db:us-east-1:962689519170:dbuser:prx-06cd44128e1465626/*

RDS-Proxy changes:
- Enabled "Transport Layer Security"
- Enabled "IAM Authentication"
